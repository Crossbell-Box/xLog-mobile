## Development
### Prerequisites

- We recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni) to help switching between repos using different package managers.

    ```sh
    npm install @antfu/ni --global
    ```


- Duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env.common`.  

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env.common
    ```

    Fill in the environment variables if you have.

    ```
    WALLET_PROJECT_ID=""
    EXPO_PROJECT_ID=""
    BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=""
    OWNER=""
    UPDATES_URL=""
    ```

    Generate types for environment variables.

    ```sh
    nr generate-env-types
    ```

- If you want to specify the environment variables for the various environments, you can create `.env.development`, `.env.staging` and `.env.production` files. (not required and supported yet)
